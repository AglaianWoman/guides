Elixir

[Sample](sample.ex)

* Avoid macros.
* Don't separate multiple declarations of the same function with a newline.
* Indent pipes by two spaces when using the match operator (`=`).
* Don't indent pipes when not using the match operator (`=`).
* Prefer pattern matching and guards in function definitions over conditionals
  in the function body.
